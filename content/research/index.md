As a member of Team Viking at ByteDance, I focus on the Viking engine --- an approximate nearest neighbor search engine that drives recommendation systems for TikTok and Douyin, and also supports VikingDB, the vector database of Volcano Engine.

Previously, I was a founding member of Moqi and led its infrastructure team. There, I directed the development of [MyScale](https://github.com/myscale/MyScaleDB), a high-performance vector and full-text search engine based on ClickHouse. I also built two nationwide billion-scale Automated Fingerprint Identification Systems (AFIS) for the Chinese public security and created the world's first contactless fingerprint scanner, the Moqi A1, which achieves image quality comparable to traditional contact-based scanners. Before Moqi, I worked as a researcher at Huawei Noah's Ark Lab.

I hold a PhD in Computer Science from The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), where I was supervised by [Prof. John C.S. Lui](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~cslui/). My research at the [Advanced Networking and System Research Laboratory](http://ansrlab.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/) (ANSRLab) focused on graph analytics and stream processing systems. Prior to my doctoral studies, I earned a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, where I was part of the [ACM Honors Class](https://acm.sjtu.edu.cn/home).

My research interests include distributed and single-machine computer systems, as well as machine learning systems.
